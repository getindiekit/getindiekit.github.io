Indiekit is a small but powerful server that acts as the go-between your website and the wider independent web.

* Publish content to your website using apps like [iAWriter](https://ia.net/writer), [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog), [Icro](https://hartl.co/apps/icro/), [Indigenous](https://indigenous.realize.be) or services that support the [Micropub API](https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org)

* Syndicate your content to social networks like Twitter, Mastodon and LinkedIn (coming soon) and save posts to the Internet Archive

* Accept likes, comments and other types of feedback on your content with Webmention (coming soon)

* Save files to different content stores such as GitHub, GitLab and Gitea

* Highly configurable, with presets available for common static site generators such as Jekyll and Hugo.

* Localisable, with initial support for English, French and German.
