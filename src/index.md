description: The little server that connects your website to the independent web.

Connect your website to writing apps like iAWriter, Micro.blog or Icro, or any application that supports the Micropub API.

Syndicate your content to social networks like Twitter, Mastodon and LinkedIn.

Accept likes, comments and other types of feedback on your content from around the web with Webmention.

## Take control

Indiekit is highly configurable and adaptable. Save files to different content stores such as GitHub, GitLab and Gitea. Get started using presets for common static site generators such as Jekyll and Hugo.

## This is for everyone

The admin interface is accessible and localisable, with initial support for English, German and French.
