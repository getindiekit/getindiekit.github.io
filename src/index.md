* Accept likes, comments and other types of feedback on your content with Webmention (coming soon)

* Syndicate your content to social networks like Twitter, Mastodon and LinkedIn (coming soon)

* Save files to different content stores such as GitHub and GitLab

* Highly configurable, with presets available for common static site generators such as Jekyll and Hugo.

* Localisable, with support for initial support for English and German.
